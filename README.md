For Gabe:

This code was was for project modeling Multi-stage rockets in non-uniform gravity for my upper level undergrad analytical mechanics course . 
The Apollo 11 mission was used for the reliable data to validate the simplified model presented in the paper.
This code is currently a WIP as there is some optimization my code could undergo, meeting with professor to do such in the near future.
